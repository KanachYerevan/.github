**Kanach Yerevan** (Green Yerevan) is an informal voluntary community aimed at protecting and preserving the green areas
of Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. The community was founded in 2023 and has since been involved in various activities
to raise awareness about environmental issues and promote sustainable development in the city.

Our main product currently is the open tree map of Yerevan.
We also hosted a number of meetings and public talks to increase awareness of the problems green spaces are facing in Yerevan.
